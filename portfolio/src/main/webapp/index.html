        <p>No matter what mood you're in, music is always a good way to spend the time. 
          It can get boring listening to the same three songs on the radio. 
          Rather than skimming through the endless sea of playlists, just take the quiz above to get recommended some music you way enjoy! 
          Don't worry, if you end up not liking the song, you can give feedback and you'll be recommended music that better suits your tastes. 
          The history tab keeps all the songs you were recommended, so it's okay if you miss the name of a song you particularly like.
          Happy listening!</p>
